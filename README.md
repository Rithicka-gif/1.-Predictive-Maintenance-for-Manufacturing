 🛠️ Predictive Maintenance for Manufacturing

🔍 Overview

This project focuses on predicting machinery failure in a manufacturing environment using real or synthetic sensor data (e.g., vibration, temperature, pressure). The goal is to forecast equipment failure ahead of time to reduce unplanned downtime and maintenance costs.

🎯 Objectives

- Predict whether a machine will fail using classification techniques.
- Use time-series sensor data like vibration, temperature, and pressure.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM).
- Enable actionable insights for proactive maintenance.
